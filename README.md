# Module_Twelve_Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Project Overview
Create a dynamic dashboard using JavaScript, as well as Plotly and D3 libraries to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
